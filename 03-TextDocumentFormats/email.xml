        Hi John,

        I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share a quick update regarding the project milestones.
        The development team has completed 80% of the tasks, and testing is scheduled to begin next Monday.
        Let me know if you'd like to review the progress report in our next meeting.
        
        Best regards,
        Jane Doe
