<h1>Laptop</h1>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid. Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is in the lower part, under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.</p>
<p>Laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work (especially on business trips), in education, for playing games, content creating, web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use. They can run on both AC power and built-in rechargable batteries, and can be folded shut for convenient storage and transportation, making them suitable for mobile use. Laptops combine essentially the same input/output components and capabilities of a desktop computer into a single unit, including a display screen (usually 11–17 in or 280–430 mm in diagonal size), small speakers, a keyboard, and a pointing device (usually touchpads). Hardware specifications may vary significantly between different types, models, and price points.</p>

<h3>Types</h3>
<h4><strong>Smaller and larger laptops</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included &quot;notebook&quot; and &quot;subnotebook&quot; models, low cost &quot;netbooks&quot;, and &quot;ultra-mobile PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and &quot;Desktop replacement&quot; laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors or graphics hardware. All of these terms have fallen out of favor as the size of mainstream laptops has gone down and their capabilities have gone up; except for niche models, laptop sizes tend to be distinguished by the size of the screen, and for more powerful models, by any specialized purpose the machine is intended for, such as a &quot;gaming laptop&quot; or a &quot;mobile workstation&quot; for professional use.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices, which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Convertibles are devices with the ability to conceal a hardware keyboard. Keyboards on such devices can be flipped, rotated, or slid behind the back of the chassis, thus transforming from a laptop into a tablet. Hybrids have a keyboard detachment mechanism, and due to this feature, all critical components are situated in the part with the display. 2-in-1s can have a hybrid or a convertible form, often dubbed 2-in-1 detachable and 2-in-1 convertibles respectively, but are distinguished by the ability to run a desktop OS, such as Windows 10. 2-in-1s are often marketed as laptop replacement tablets. As with nearly all of these distinctions, they are marketing terms first and technical distinctions secondarily, and vendors are not consistent in using a single name for a given type of device.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2-in-1s are often very thin, around 10 millimetres (0.39 in), and light devices with a long battery life. 2-in-1s are distinguished from mainstream tablets as they feature an x86-architecture CPU (typically a low- or ultra-low-voltage model), such as the Intel Core i5, run a full-featured desktop OS like Windows 10, and have a number of typical laptop I/O ports, such as USB 3 and Mini DisplayPort.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2-in-1s are designed to be used not only as a media consumption device but also as valid desktop or laptop replacements, due to their ability to run desktop applications, such as Adobe Photoshop. It is possible to connect multiple peripheral devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, and several external displays to a modern 2-in-1.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft Surface Pro-series devices and Surface Book are examples of modern 2-in-1 detachable, whereas Lenovo Yoga-series computers are a variant of 2-in-1 convertibles. While the older Surface RT and Surface 2 have the same chassis design as the Surface Pro, their use of ARM processors and Windows RT do not classify them as 2-in-1s, but as hybrid tablets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The distinction between a &quot;tablet with a keyboard&quot; and a 2-in-1 laptop generally rests on the operating system; if they run a mobile operating system, such as Android or IOS, they are generally marketed as tablets, while if they run a general purpose operating system like Windows or MacOS, they are generally marketed as laptops.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>Rugged laptop</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than regular laptops, and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has increasingly narrowed.</p>
<p>In general, laptop components are not intended to be replaceable or upgradable by the end-user, except for components that can be detached; in the past, batteries and optical drives were commonly exchangeable. In the past, many laptops featured socketed processors but as of 2025 virtually all laptops use processors that are soldered to the motherboard. Many laptops come with RAM that is soldered to the motherboard and cannot be easily replaced.</p>
<p>This restriction is one of the major differences between laptops and desktop computers, because the large &quot;tower&quot; cases used in desktop computers are designed so that new motherboards, hard disks, sound cards, RAM, and other components can be added. Memory and storage can often be upgraded with some disassembly, but with the most compact laptops, there may be no upgradeable components at all.</p>
